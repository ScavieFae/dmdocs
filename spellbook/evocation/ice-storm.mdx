Hail falls in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the Cylinder makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 Bludgeoning damage and 4d6 Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn ground in the Cylinder into Difficult Terrain until the end of your next turn.
