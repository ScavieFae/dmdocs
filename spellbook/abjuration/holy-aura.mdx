For the duration, you emit an aura in a 30-foot Emanation. While in the aura, creatures of your choice have Advantage on all saving throws, and other creatures have Disadvantage on attack rolls against them. In addition, when a Fiend or an Undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack roll, the attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn.
