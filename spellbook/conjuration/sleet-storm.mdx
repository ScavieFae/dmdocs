Until the spell ends, sleet falls in a 40-foot-tall, 20-foot-radius Cylinder centered on a point you choose within range. The area is Heavily Obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.

Ground in the Cylinder is Difficult Terrain. When a creature enters the Cylinder for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a

Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition and lose Concentration.
