For the duration, you sense the presence of magical effects within 30 feet of yourself. If you sense magic in this way, you can take a Magic action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears the magic, and if the magic was created by a spell, you learn the spell's school of magic.

The spell can penetrate most barriers but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
