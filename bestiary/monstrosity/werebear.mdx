## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The werebear makes two attacks, using Handaxe or Rend in any combination. It can replace one attack with a Bite attack.
***Bite (Bear or Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +7, reach 5 ft. 17 (2d12 + 4) Piercing damage. If the target is a Humanoid, it is subjected to the following effect. *Constitution Saving Throw*: DC 14. *Failure:*  The target is cursed. If the cursed target drops to 0 Hit Points, it instead becomes a Werebear under the DM's control and has 10 Hit Points. *Success:*  The target is immune to this werebear's curse for 24 hours.
***Handaxe (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee or Ranged Attack Roll:* +7, reach 5 ft or range 20/60 ft. 14 (3d6 + 4) Slashing damage.

## Bonus Actions
