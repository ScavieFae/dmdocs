## Bonus Actions

***Petrifying Gaze (Recharge 5-6).*** *Constitution Saving Throw*: DC 13, each creature in a 30-foot Cone. If the medusa sees its reflection in the Cone, the medusa must make this save. *First Failure* The target has the Restrained condition and repeats the save at the end of its next turn if it is still Restrained, ending the effect on itself on a success. *Second Failure* The target has the Petrified condition instead of the Restrained condition.
