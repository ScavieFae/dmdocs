***Ice Walk.*** The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, Difficult Terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three Rend attacks.
***Rend.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +11, reach 10 ft. 13 (2d6 + 6) Slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) Cold damage.
***Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** *Constitution Saving Throw*: DC 19, each creature in a 60-foot Cone. *Failure:*  54 (12d8) Cold damage. *Success:*  Half damage.

## Legendary Actions

***Freezing Burst.*** *Constitution Saving Throw*: DC 14, each creature in a 30-foot-radius Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet. *Failure:*  7 (2d6) Cold damage, and the target's Speed is 0 until the end of the target's next turn. *Failure or Success*:  The dragon can't take this action again until the start of its next turn.
