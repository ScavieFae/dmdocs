## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Lair).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three Rend attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of (A) Sleep Breath or (B) Spellcasting to cast *Scorching Ray*.
***Rend.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +11, reach 10 ft. 17 (2d10 + 6) Slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) Fire damage.
***Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** *Dexterity Saving Throw*: DC 18, each creature in a 60-foot-long, 5-foot-wide Line. *Failure:*  45 (10d8) Fire damage. *Success:*  Half damage.
***Sleep Breath.*** *Constitution Saving Throw*: DC 18, each creature in a 60-foot Cone. *Failure:*  The target has the Incapacitated condition until the end of its next turn, at which point it repeats the save. *Second Failure* The target has the Unconscious condition for 10 minutes. This effect ends for the target if it takes damage or a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to wake it.
***Spellcasting.*** The dragon casts one of the following spells, requiring no Material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):
- **At Will:** *Detect Magic*, *Minor Illusion*, *Scorching Ray*, *Shapechange*, *Speak with Animals*
- **1e/Day Each:** *Detect Thoughts*, *Control Weather*

## Legendary Actions

***Pounce.*** The dragon moves up to half its Speed, and it makes one Rend attack.
***Scorching Sands.*** *Dexterity Saving Throw*: DC 16, one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet. *Failure:*  27 (6d8) Fire damage, and the target's Speed is halved until the end of its next turn. *Failure or Success*:  The dragon can't take this action again until the start of its next turn.
