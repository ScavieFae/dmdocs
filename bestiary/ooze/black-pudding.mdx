## Traits

***Amorphous.*** The pudding can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without expending extra movement to do so.
***Corrosive Form.*** A creature that hits the pudding with a melee attack roll takes 4 (1d8) Acid damage. Nonmagical ammunition is destroyed immediately after hitting the pudding and dealing any damage. Any nonmagical weapon takes a cumulative -1 penalty to attack rolls immediately after dealing damage to the pudding and coming into contact with it. The weapon is destroyed if the penalty reaches -5. The penalty can be removed by casting the *Mending* spell on the weapon.
In 1 minute, the pudding can eat through 2 feet of nonmagical wood or metal.
***Spider Climb.*** The pudding can climb difficult surfaces, including along ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

## Actions

***Dissolving Pseudopod.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5, reach 10 ft. 17 (4d6 + 3) Acid damage. Nonmagical armor worn by the target takes a -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10. The penalty can be removed by casting the *Mending* spell on the armor.
