## Traits

***Amorphous.*** The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without expending extra movement to do so.
***Corrosive Form.*** Nonmagical ammunition is destroyed immediately after hitting the ooze and dealing any damage. Any nonmagical weapon takes a cumulative -1 penalty to attack rolls immediately after dealing damage to the ooze and coming into contact with it. The weapon is destroyed if the penalty reaches -5. The penalty can be removed by casting the *Mending* spell on the weapon.
The ooze can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal or wood in 1 round.

## Actions

***Pseudopod.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +3, reach 5 ft. 10 (2d8 + 1) Acid damage. Nonmagical armor worn by the target takes a -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10. The penalty can be removed by casting the *Mending* spell on the armor.
