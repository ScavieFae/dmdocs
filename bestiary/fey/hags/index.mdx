# Hags

Hags are malevolent fey creatures that delight in misery and corruption. Though they appear as withered crones, they possess powerful magic and cunning intellect.

## Hag Covens

When three hags of any type form a coven, their combined magic grows exponentially more powerful. Covens often include hags of different types working together.

| Hag | CR | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|------|-------------|
| [Sea Hag](sea-hag) | 2 | Fey | Lurkers in coastal waters who weaponize their horrific appearance |
| [Green Hag](green-hag) | 3 | Fey | Swamp-dwelling deceivers and masters of illusion |
| [Night Hag](../fiend/night-hag) | 5 | Fiend | Planar travelers who harvest souls through nightmares |
