## Traits

***Inscrutable.*** No magic can observe the sphinx remotely or detect its thoughts without its permission. Wisdom (Insight) checks made to ascertain its intentions or sincerity are made with Disadvantage.
***Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Lair).*** If the sphinx fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The sphinx makes two Claw attacks and uses Roar.
***Claw.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +12, reach 5 ft. 20 (4d6 + 6) Slashing damage.
***Roar (3/Day).*** The sphinx emits a magical roar. Whenever it roars, the roar has a different effect, as detailed below (the sequence resets when it takes a Long Rest):
- **First Roar**: *Wisdom Saving Throw*: DC 20, each enemy in a 500-foot Emanation originating from the sphinx. *Failure:*  The target has the Frightened condition for 1 minute.
- **Second Roar**: *Wisdom Saving Throw*: DC 20, each enemy in a 500-foot Emanation originating from the sphinx. *Failure:*  The target has the Paralyzed condition, and it repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.
- **Third Roar**: *Constitution Saving Throw*: DC 20, each enemy in a 500-foot Emanation originating from the sphinx. *Failure:*  44 (8d10) Thunder damage, and the target has the Prone condition. *Success:*  Half damage only.
***Spellcasting.*** The sphinx casts one of the following spells, requiring no Material components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 20):
- **At Will:** *Detect Evil and Good*, *Thaumaturgy*
- **1e/Day Each:** *Detect Magic*, *Dispel Magic*, *Greater Restoration*, *Heroes' Feast*, *Zone of Truth*

## Legendary Actions

***Arcane Prowl.*** The sphinx can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, and it makes one Claw attack.
***Weight of Years.*** *Constitution Saving Throw*: DC 16, one creature the sphinx can see within 120 feet. *Failure:*  The target gains 1 Exhaustion level. While the target has any Exhaustion levels, it appears 3d10 years older. *Failure or Success*:  The sphinx can't take this action again until the start of its next turn.
