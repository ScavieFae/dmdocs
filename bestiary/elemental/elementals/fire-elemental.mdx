## Traits

***Fire Aura.*** At the end of each of the elemental's turns, each creature in a 10-foot Emanation originating from the elemental takes 5 (1d10) Fire damage. Creatures and flammable objects in the Emanation start Hitazard burning.
***Fire Form.*** The elemental can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without expending extra movement to do so, and it can enter a creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) Fire damage.
***Illumination.*** The elemental sheds Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet.
***Water Susceptibility.*** The elemental takes 3 (1d6) Cold damage for every 5 feet the elemental moves in water or for every gallon of water splashed on it.

## Actions

***Burn.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +6, reach 5 ft. 10 (2d6 + 3) Fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it starts burning.
