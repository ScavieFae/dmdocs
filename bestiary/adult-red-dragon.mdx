## Overview

The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures.

## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (18d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- Magma erupts from a point the dragon can see within 120 feet
- Volcanic gases fill a 20-foot-radius sphere
- Tremors shake the lair
