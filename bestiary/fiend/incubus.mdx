## Traits

***Succubus Form.*** When the incubus finishes a Long Rest, it can shape-shift into a Succubus, using that stat block instead of this one. Any equipment it's wearing or carrying isn't transformed.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The incubus makes two Restless Touch attacks.
***Restless Touch.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +7, reach 5 ft. 15 (3d6 + 5) Psychic damage, and the target is cursed for 24 hours or until the incubus dies. Until the curse ends, the target gains no benefit from finishing Short Rests.
***Spellcasting.*** The incubus casts one of the following spells, requiring no Material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):
- **At Will:** *Disguise Self*, *Etherealness*
- **1e/Day Each:** *Dream*, *Hypnotic Pattern*

## Bonus Actions

***Nightmare (Recharge 6).*** *Wisdom Saving Throw*: DC 15, one creature the incubus can see within 60 feet. *Failure:*  If the target has 20 Hit Points or fewer, it has the Unconscious condition for 1 hour, until it takes damage, or until a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to wake it. Otherwise, the target takes 18 (4d8) Psychic damage.
