## Traits

***Demonic Restoration.*** If the vrock dies outside the Abyss, its body dissolves into ichor, and it gains a new body instantly, reviving with all its Hit Points somewhere in the Abyss.
***Magic Resistance.*** The vrock has Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The vrock makes two Shred attacks.
***Shred.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +6, reach 5 ft. 10 (2d6 + 3) Piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) Poison damage.
***Spores (Recharge 6).*** *Constitution Saving Throw*: DC 15, each creature in a 20-foot Emanation originating from the vrock. *Failure:*  The target has the Poisoned condition and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. While Poisoned, the target takes 5 (1d10) Poison damage at the start of each of its turns. Emptying a flask of Holy Water on the target ends the effect early.
***Stunning Screech (1/Day).*** *Constitution Saving Throw*: DC 15, each creature in a 20-foot Emanation originating from the vrock (demons succeed automatically). *Failure:*  10 (3d6) Thunder damage, and the target has the Stunned condition until the end of the vrock's next turn.
