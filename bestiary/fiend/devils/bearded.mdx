## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The devil has Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The devil makes one Beard attack and one Infernal Glaive attack.
***Beard.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5, reach 5 ft. 7 (1d8 + 3) Piercing damage, and the target has the Poisoned condition until the start of the devil's next turn. Until this poison ends, the target can't regain Hit Points.
***Infernal Glaive.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5, reach 10 ft. 8 (1d10 + 3) Slashing damage. If the target is a creature and doesn't already have an infernal wound, it is subjected to the following effect. *Constitution Saving Throw*: DC 12. *Failure:*  The target receives an infernal wound. While wounded, the target loses 5 (1d10) Hit Points at the start of each of its turns. The wound closes after 1 minute, after a spell restores Hit Points to the target, or after the target or a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to stanch the wound, doing so by succeeding on a DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
