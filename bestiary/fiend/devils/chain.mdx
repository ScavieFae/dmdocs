## Traits

***Diabolical Restoration.*** If the devil dies outside the Nine Hells, its body disappears in sulfurous smoke, and it gains a new body instantly, reviving with all its Hit Points somewhere in the Nine Hells.
***Magic Resistance.*** The devil has Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The devil makes two Chain attacks and uses Conjure Infernal Chain.
***Chain.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +7, reach 10 ft. 11 (2d6 + 4) Slashing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the Grappled condition (escape DC 14) from one of two chains, and it has the Restrained condition until the grapple ends.
***Conjure Infernal Chain.*** The devil conjures a fiery chain to bind a creature. *Dexterity Saving Throw*: DC 15, one creature the devil can see within 60 feet. *Failure:*  9 (2d4 + 4) Fire damage, and the target has the Restrained condition until the end of the devil's next turn, at which point the chain disappears.
