# Magic Items

Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of conquered monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner's capabilities in wondrous ways.

## Rarity

Magic items have a rarity that reflects how difficult they are to find:

| Rarity | Character Level |
|--------|-----------------|
| Common | 1st or higher |
| Uncommon | 1st or higher |
| Rare | 5th or higher |
| Very Rare | 11th or higher |
| Legendary | 17th or higher |
| Artifact | Unique items of immense power |

## Attunement

Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement. A creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time.
