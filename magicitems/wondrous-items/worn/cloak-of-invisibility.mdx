This cloak has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the cloak, you can take a Magic action to pull its hood over your head and expend 1 charge to give yourself the Invisible condition for 1 hour. The effect ends early if you pull the hood down (no action required) or cease wearing the cloak.
