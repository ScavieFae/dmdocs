title: Feats
description: Special abilities and talents beyond class features
---

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

## How Feats Work

Your background gives you a feat, and you gain more feats at certain levels depending on your class. The Ability Score Improvement feature in your class also lets you take a feat instead of increasing ability scores.

**Feat Categories.** Feats fall into categories: Origin, General, Fighting Style, and Epic Boon. A feat's category indicates when a character typically has access to that feat.

**Repeatable Feats.** You can take a feat only once unless its description says otherwise.

**Prerequisites.** Some feats have prerequisites. You must meet every prerequisite specified to take a feat. If you ever lose a prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.
