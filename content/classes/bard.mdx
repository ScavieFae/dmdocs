### Level 1: Bardic Inspiration

You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.

**Using Bardic Inspiration.** As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

Once within the next hour when the creature fails a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it's rolled.

**Number of Uses.** You can confer Bardic Inspiration a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

**At Higher Levels.** Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table.

### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in the Bard spell list later in the class's description.

**Cantrips.** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. Dancing Lights and Vicious Mockery are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list.

When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard Features table.

**Spell Slots.** The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list. Charm Person, Color Spray, Dissonant Whispers, and Healing Word are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Bard Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.

### Level 2: Expertise

You gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Performance and Persuasion are recommended if you have proficiency in them.

### Level 2: Jack of All Trades

You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your Proficiency Bonus.

### Level 3: Bard Subclass

You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The College of Lore subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Bard level or lower.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8, 12, and 16.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Tier 2 (Levels 5-10)">

### Level 5: Font of Inspiration

You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action required) to regain one expended use of Bardic Inspiration.

### Level 7: Countercharm

You can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage.

### Level 9: Expertise

You gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Tier 3 (Levels 11-16)">

No new base class features at these levels. Your power comes from subclass features (levels 10 and 14), Ability Score Improvements (levels 12 and 16), higher-level spells, and your improved Bardic Inspiration die (d10 at level 10, d12 at level 15).

</Tab>
<Tab value="Tier 4 (Levels 17-20)">

### Level 18: Superior Inspiration

When you roll Initiative, you regain two expended uses of Bardic Inspiration.

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended.

### Level 20: Words of Creation

You have mastered two of the Words of Creation: the words of life and death. You therefore always have the Power Word Heal and Power Word Kill spells prepared.

When you cast either spell, you can target a second creature with it if that creature is within 10 feet of the first target.

## Bard Subclass: College of Lore

*Plumb the Depths of Magical Knowledge*

Bards of the College of Lore plumb the depths of magical knowledge, collecting spells and secrets from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes, mystical rites, and peasant tales. The college's members gather in libraries and universities to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

#### Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

#### Level 3: Cutting Words

You learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes a damage roll or succeeds on an ability check or attack roll, you can take a Reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration, roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and subtract the number rolled from the creature's roll, reducing the damage or potentially turning the success into a failure.

#### Level 6: Magical Discoveries

You learn two spells of your choice from any spell list. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown in the Bard Features table. The chosen spells count as Bard spells for you, and they are always prepared.

#### Level 10: Magical Discoveries

You learn two more spells following the rules of Magical Discoveries.

#### Level 14: Peerless Skill

When you make an ability check or attack roll and fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration, roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning a failure into a success. On a failure, the Bardic Inspiration isn't expended.
