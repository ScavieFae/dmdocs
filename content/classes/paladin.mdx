<Tab value="Tier 1 (Levels 1-4)">

### Level 1: Lay on Hands

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.

As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.

You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature; those points don't also restore Hit Points to the creature.

### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to draw on divine magic through prayer and meditation. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the Paladin spell list later in the class's description.

**Spell Slots.** The Paladin Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 spells from the Paladin spell list. Bless and Divine Smite are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Paladin spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.

### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.

### Level 2: Fighting Style

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice. Defense is recommended.

Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace the feat you chose with a different Fighting Style feat.

### Level 2: Paladin's Smite

You always have the Divine Smite spell prepared. In addition, you can cast it without expending a spell slot, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again.

### Level 3: Channel Divinity

You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class's Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create from among those you have from this class.

You can use this class's Channel Divinity twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Paladin levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Paladin Features table.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.

**Divine Sense.** As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.

### Level 3: Paladin Subclass

You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice. The Oath of Devotion subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Paladin level or lower.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin levels 8, 12, and 16.

<Tab value="Tier 2 (Levels 5-10)">

### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Level 5: Faithful Steed

You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You always have the Find Steed spell prepared.

You can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 6: Aura of Protection

You radiate a protective, invisible aura that extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but it doesn't extend through Total Cover.

You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which aura while in them.

### Level 9: Abjure Foes

As a Magic action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself.

Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While Frightened in this way, the target can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action.

On a successful save, the target's Speed is 0 until the end of your next turn.

### Level 10: Aura of Courage

You and your allies in your Aura of Protection have Immunity to the Frightened condition.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Tier 3 (Levels 11-16)">

### Level 11: Radiant Strikes

Your strikes carry divine power. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike, the target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage.

### Level 14: Restoring Touch

When you use Lay on Hands on a creature, you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Frightened, Paralyzed, or Stunned. You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool for each of these conditions you remove; this healing doesn't restore Hit Points to the creature.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Tier 4 (Levels 17-20)">

### Level 18: Aura Expansion

Your Aura of Protection now extends 30 feet from you rather than 10 feet.

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Truesight is recommended.

## Paladin Subclass: Oath of Devotion

*Uphold the Ideals of Justice and Order*

The Oath of Devotion binds a Paladin to the ideals of justice and order. These Paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some—for better or worse—hold the rest of the world to the same standards.

#### Level 3: Oath of Devotion Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Devotion Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|---------------|--------|
| 3 | Protection from Evil and Good, Shield of Faith |
| 5 | Aid, Zone of Truth |
| 9 | Beacon of Hope, Dispel Magic |
| 13 | Freedom of Movement, Guardian of Faith |
| 17 | Commune, Flame Strike |

#### Level 3: Sacred Weapon

When you take the Attack action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to imbue one Melee weapon that you are holding with positive energy. For 10 minutes or until you use this feature again, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls you make with that weapon (minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light 20 feet beyond that.

You can end this effect early (no action required). This effect also ends if you no longer hold the weapon or if you have the Incapacitated condition.

#### Level 7: Aura of Devotion

You and your allies in your Aura of Protection have Immunity to the Charmed condition.

#### Level 15: Smite of Protection

Your magical smite now radiates protective energy. Whenever you cast Divine Smite, you and your allies have Half Cover while in your Aura of Protection. The aura has this benefit until the start of your next turn.

#### Level 20: Holy Nimbus

As a Bonus Action, you can imbue your Aura of Protection with holy power, granting the benefits below for 10 minutes or until you end them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).

**Holy Ward.** You have Advantage on any saving throw you are forced to make by a Fiend or an Undead.

**Radiant Damage.** Whenever an enemy starts its turn in the aura, that creature takes Radiant damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus plus your Charisma modifier.

**Sunlight.** The aura is filled with Bright Light.
