### Level 1: Eldritch Invocations

You have unearthed eldritch invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons from your patron. You gain one invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Blade or Pact of the Tome. Invocations are described in the "Eldritch Invocation Options" section later in this class's description.

**Prerequisites.** If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn the invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5.

**Replacing and Gaining Invocations.** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can't replace an invocation if it's a prerequisite for another invocation that you know.

When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table.

### Level 1: Pact Magic

Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the Warlock spell list later in the class's description.

**Cantrips.** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Warlock spell list. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Warlock spell list.

When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Warlock spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.

**Spell Slots.** The Warlock Spell Slots table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

| Warlock Level | Spell Slots | Slot Level |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 2 | 2 |
| 4 | 2 | 2 |
| 5 | 2 | 3 |
| 6 | 2 | 3 |
| 7 | 2 | 4 |
| 8 | 2 | 4 |
| 9 | 2 | 5 |
| 10 | 2 | 5 |
| 11–16 | 3 | 5 |
| 17–20 | 4 | 5 |

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 spells from the Warlock spell list. Charm Person and Hex are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Warlock spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.

If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.

### Level 2: Magical Cunning

You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 3: Warlock Subclass

You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The Fiend Patron subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Warlock level or lower.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 8, 12, and 16.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Tier 2 (Levels 5-10)">

### Level 9: Contact Patron

In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the Contact Other Plane spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell's saving throw.

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Tier 3 (Levels 11-16)">

### Level 11: Mystic Arcanum

Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 spell from the Warlock spell list as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again.

As shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a Long Rest.

Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Tier 4 (Levels 17-20)">

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended.

### Level 20: Eldritch Master

When you use your Magical Cunning feature, you regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots.

You can cast Mage Armor on yourself without expending a spell slot.

### Ascendant Step

### Eldritch Spear

*Prerequisite: Eldritch Blast cantrip*

The range of Eldritch Blast increases to 300 feet.

### Fiendish Vigor

You can cast False Life on yourself without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell with this feature, you don't roll the die for the Temporary Hit Points; you automatically get the highest number on the die.

### Gaze of Two Minds

*Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock*

You can use a Bonus Action to touch a willing creature and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can take a Bonus Action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. The connection ends if you don't maintain it in this way.

While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you can cast spells as if you were in that creature's space.

### Investment of the Chain Master

*Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Chain*

When you cast Find Familiar, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: Imp, Pseudodragon, Quasit, or Sprite.

You have received knowledge from an elder entity of the multiverse, allowing you to gain one Origin feat of your choice.

**Repeatable.** You can gain this invocation more than once. Each time you do so, choose a different Origin feat.

### Lifedrinker

*Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade*

Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can deal an extra 1d6 Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage (your choice) to the creature, and you can expend one of your Hit Point Dice to roll it and regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point).

You can cast Alter Self without expending a spell slot.

You can cast Jump on yourself without expending a spell slot.

### Pact of the Blade

As a Bonus Action, you can conjure a pact weapon in your hand—a Simple or Martial Melee weapon of your choice with which you bond—or create a bond with a magic weapon you touch; you can't bond with a magic weapon if someone else is attuned to it or another Warlock is bonded with it. Until the bond ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus.

Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal damage type.

Your bond with the weapon ends if you use this feature's Bonus Action again, if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, or if you die. A conjured weapon disappears when the bond ends.

### Pact of the Chain

You learn the Find Familiar spell and can cast it as a Magic action without expending a spell slot.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: Imp, Pseudodragon, Quasit, or Sprite.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its Reaction.

### Pact of the Tome

Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure forth a book in your hand at the end of a Short or Long Rest. This Book of Shadows contains eldritch magic that only you can access, granting you the following benefits:

**Cantrips and Rituals.** When the book appears, choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells that have the Ritual tag. The spells can be from any class's spell list, and they must be spells you don't already have prepared. While the book is on your person, you have the chosen spells prepared, and they function as Warlock spells for you.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use the book as a Spellcasting Focus.

The book disappears if you conjure another book with this feature or if you die.

### Repelling Blast

*Prerequisite: Eldritch Blast cantrip*

When you hit a creature with Eldritch Blast, you can push that creature up to 10 feet straight away from you.

### Thirsting Blade

*Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade*

## Warlock Subclass: Fiend Patron

*Bargain with a Lower Planes Entity*

Your pact draws on the Lower Planes, the realms of perdition. You might forge a bargain with a demon lord such as Demogorgon or Orcus; an archdevil such as Asmodeus; or a pit fiend, balor, yugoloth, or night hag that is especially mighty. That patron's aims are evil—the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you—and your path is one that leads to your own destruction unless you wrest your freedom from your patron.

#### Level 3: Dark One's Blessing

When you reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma modifier plus your Warlock level (minimum of 1 Temporary Hit Point).

#### Level 3: Fiend Spells

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Fiend Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Warlock Level | Spells |
|---------------|--------|
| 3 | Burning Hands, Command, Scorching Ray |
| 5 | Fireball, Stinking Cloud |
| 7 | Fire Shield, Wall of Fire |
| 9 | Geas, Insect Plague |

#### Level 6: Dark One's Own Luck

You can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add 1d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 10: Fiendish Resilience

Choose one damage type when you finish a Short or Long Rest. You have Resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature.

#### Level 14: Hurl Through Hell

Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can try to instantly transport the target through the Lower Planes. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, or the target disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. The target takes 8d10 Psychic damage if it isn't a Fiend, and it has the Incapacitated condition until the end of your next turn, when it returns to the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a level 4+ spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.
