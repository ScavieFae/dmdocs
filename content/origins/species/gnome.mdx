Gnomes are magical folk created by gods of invention, illusion, and underground realms. The earliest gnomes were seldom combatants, preferring to rely on illusion and misdirection. They appear throughout the multiverse, including the Feywild and many Material Plane worlds, where their tales inspire curiosity and delight.

## Special Traits

### Darkvision

You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

### Gnomish Cunning

You have Advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

### Gnomish Lineage

You are part of a lineage that grants you supernatural abilities. Choose one of the following options; whichever one you choose, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the lineage):

**Forest Gnome.** You know the *Minor Illusion* cantrip. You can also cast the *Speak with Animals* spell with this trait. You can cast it with the trait a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You can also use any spell slots you have to cast the spell.

**Rock Gnome.** You know the *Mending* and *Prestidigitation* cantrips. In addition, you can spend 10 minutes casting *Prestidigitation* to create a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 HP), such as a toy, fire starter, or music box. When you create the device, you determine what action it takes when a creature uses a Bonus Action to activate it within a range of 10 feet. You can have three such devices in existence at a time, and each falls apart 8 hours after creation or when dismantled with a touch.
