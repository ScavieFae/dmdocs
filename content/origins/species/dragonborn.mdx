The ancestors of dragonborn hatched from the eggs of chromatic and metallic dragons. One story holds that these eggs were blessed by the dragon gods Bahamut and Tiamat, who wanted to populate the multiverse with people created in their image. Another story claims that dragons created dragonborn without the gods' aid.

## Special Traits

### Draconic Ancestry

Your lineage stems from a dragon progenitor. Choose the kind of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table. Your choice affects your Breath Weapon and Damage Resistance traits, as well as your appearance.

### Breath Weapon

When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in either a 15-foot Cone or a 30-foot Line that is 5 feet wide (your choice each time). Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + your Constitution modifier + your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

The damage increases to 2d10 at character level 5, 3d10 at level 11, and 4d10 at level 17.

You can use this Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

### Damage Resistance

You have Resistance to the damage type determined by your Draconic Ancestry.

### Darkvision

You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.
