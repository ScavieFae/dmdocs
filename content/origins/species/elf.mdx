Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace. Created by the god Corellon, the first elves could change their physical forms at will. After Lolth's betrayal and banishment to the Abyss, most elves lost the ability to shape-shift, yet traces of their original mutability remain—particularly in the distinct lineages that emerged.
