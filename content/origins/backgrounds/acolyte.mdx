## Magic Initiate (Cleric)

*Origin Feat*

You have learned the basics of a magical tradition. Choose one of the following:

**Spells.** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list and one level 1 spell from the same list. You can cast the level 1 spell without expending a spell slot once per Long Rest, and you can also cast it using any spell slots you have.

**Spell Change.** Whenever you gain a new level, you can replace one of the spells you chose for this feat with a different spell of the same level from the Cleric spell list.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
