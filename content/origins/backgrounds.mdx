title: Backgrounds
description: Four backgrounds representing your character's history before becoming an adventurer
---

Your character's background is a collection of characteristics that represent the place and occupation that were most formative before your character embarked on a life of adventure.

## Parts of a Background

A background includes the following parts.

**Ability Scores.** A background lists three of your character's ability scores. Increase one by 2 and another one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None of these increases can raise a score above 20.

**Feat.** A background gives your character a specified Origin feat (described in "Feats").

**Skill Proficiencies.** A background gives your character proficiency in two specified skills.

**Tool Proficiency.** Each background gives a character proficiency with one tool—either a specific tool or one chosen from the Artisan's Tools category. Tools are detailed in "Equipment."

**Equipment.** Each background offers a choice between a package of equipment and 50 GP.
