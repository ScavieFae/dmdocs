The **System Reference Document (SRD)** contains the core rules for D&D 5th Edition, released under Creative Commons. This site makes that content searchable, browsable, and quick to reference — whether you're mid-session or building a character.

Use **⌘K** (or **Ctrl+K**) to search, or start with one of these:

## What's in the SRD?

The SRD includes the essential rules, but not everything from the Player's Handbook. You'll find:

- **12 classes** with one subclass each (Champion Fighter, Life Cleric, etc.)
- **9 species** (Dwarf, Elf, Halfling, Human, Dragonborn, Gnome, Orc, Goliath, Tiefling)
- **17 feats** (Origin, General, Fighting Style, and Epic Boon categories)
- **Full combat rules**, conditions, and gameplay mechanics
- **Equipment**, armor, and weapons tables

For the complete class options, additional subclasses, or expanded content, you'll need the full sourcebooks.
