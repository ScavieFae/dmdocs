While going on adventures, your character gains experience, represented by Experience Points (XP). A character who reaches a specified Experience Point total advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level.

## Character Advancement

The table below lists the XP you need to advance to a level and the Proficiency Bonus for a character of that level. When your XP total equals or exceeds a number in the Experience Points column, you reach the corresponding level.

| Level | Experience Points | Proficiency Bonus |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 0 | +2 |
| 2 | 300 | +2 |
| 3 | 900 | +2 |
| 4 | 2,700 | +2 |
| 5 | 6,500 | +3 |
| 6 | 14,000 | +3 |
| 7 | 23,000 | +3 |
| 8 | 34,000 | +3 |
| 9 | 48,000 | +4 |
| 10 | 64,000 | +4 |
| 11 | 85,000 | +4 |
| 12 | 100,000 | +4 |
| 13 | 120,000 | +5 |
| 14 | 140,000 | +5 |
| 15 | 165,000 | +5 |
| 16 | 195,000 | +5 |
| 17 | 225,000 | +6 |
| 18 | 265,000 | +6 |
| 19 | 305,000 | +6 |
| 20 | 355,000 | +6 |

## Gaining a Level

When you gain a level, follow these steps:

**1: Choose a Class.** Most characters advance in the same class. However, you might decide to gain a level in another class using the multiclassing rules.

**2: Adjust Hit Points and Hit Point Dice.** Each time you gain a level, you gain an additional Hit Die. Roll that die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your Hit Point maximum. Instead of rolling, you can use the fixed value shown below.

| Class | Hit Points per Level |
|-------|---------------------|
| Barbarian | 7 + Con. modifier |
| Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger | 6 + Con. modifier |
| Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, or Warlock | 5 + Con. modifier |
| Sorcerer or Wizard | 4 + Con. modifier |

**3: Record New Class Features.** Look at your class features table in "Classes," and note the features you gain at your new level in that class. Make any choices offered by a new feature.

**4: Adjust Proficiency Bonus.** A character's Proficiency Bonus increases at certain levels, as shown in the Character Advancement table and your class features table. When your Proficiency Bonus increases, increase all the numbers on your character sheet that include your Proficiency Bonus.

**5: Adjust Ability Modifiers.** If you choose a feat that increases one or more of your ability scores, your ability modifier also changes if the new score is an even number. When that happens, adjust all the numbers on your character sheet that use that ability modifier. When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your Hit Point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.

## Tiers of Play

With each new level, characters acquire new capabilities that equip them to handle greater challenges. As characters advance in level, the tone of the game also changes, and the stakes of the campaign get higher.

### Tier 1 (Levels 1–4)

In tier 1, characters are apprentice adventurers, though they are already set apart from the broader populace by virtue of their extraordinary abilities. They learn their starting class features and choose a subclass. The threats they face usually pose a danger to local farmsteads or villages.

### Tier 2 (Levels 5–10)

In tier 2, characters are full-fledged adventurers. Spellcasters gain iconic spells such as Fireball, Lightning Bolt, and Raise Dead. Most weapon-focused classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in a round. The characters now face dangers that threaten cities and kingdoms.

### Tier 3 (Levels 11–16)

In tier 3, characters have reached a level of power that makes them special among adventurers. At level 11, many spellcasters learn reality-altering spells. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or to do more impressive things with those attacks. These adventurers often confront threats to whole regions.

### Tier 4 (Levels 17–20)

At tier 4, characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic archetypes. The fate of the world or even the order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during their adventures.

## Bonus Feats at Level 20

A GM can use feats as a form of advancement after characters reach level 20 to provide greater power to characters who have no more levels to gain. With this approach, each character gains one feat of their choice for every 30,000 XP the character earns above 355,000 XP. Epic Boon feats are especially appropriate for these bonus feats, but a player can choose any feat for which their level 20 character qualifies.
