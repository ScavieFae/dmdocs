title: Create Your Character
description: The five steps to making a D&D character—class, origin, ability scores, alignment, and details
---

Here are the steps to make a character; each step is explored in detail:

1. **Choose a Class.** Every adventurer is a member of a class. A class broadly describes a character's vocation, special talents, and favored tactics.
2. **Determine Origin.** A character's origin includes two elements: background and species. How did the character spend the years leading up to a life of adventure? Who are the character's ancestors? You can also choose your character's languages.
3. **Determine Ability Scores.** Much of what your character does in the game depends on the character's six abilities.
4. **Choose an Alignment.** Alignment is a shorthand for your character's moral compass.
5. **Fill in Details.** Using the choices you've made, fill in the remaining details on your character sheet.

## Step 1: Choose Class

Choose a class, and write it on your character sheet. See "Classes" for the classes' details.

| Class | Likes... | Primary Ability | Complexity |
|-------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| Barbarian | Battle | Strength | Average |
| Bard | Performing | Charisma | High |
| Cleric | Gods | Wisdom | Average |
| Druid | Nature | Wisdom | High |
| Fighter | Weapons | Strength or Dexterity | Low |
| Monk | Unarmed combat | Dexterity and Wisdom | High |
| Paladin | Defense | Strength and Charisma | Average |
| Ranger | Survival | Dexterity and Wisdom | Average |
| Rogue | Stealth | Dexterity | Low |
| Sorcerer | Power | Charisma | High |
| Warlock | Occult lore | Charisma | High |
| Wizard | Spellbooks | Intelligence | Average |

### Write Your Level

Write your character's level on your character sheet. Typically, a character starts at level 1 and advances in level by adventuring and gaining Experience Points (XP).

**Write Your XP.** Also record your Experience Points. A level 1 character has 0 XP.

**Starting at a Higher Level.** Your GM might start you at a higher level. If you start at level 3 or higher, write your chosen subclass on your character sheet.

### Note Armor Training

Your class might give you training with certain categories of armor. Note your armor training on your character sheet. Armor training with a kind of armor means you can wear that armor effectively, gaining defensive bonuses from it.

## Step 2: Character Origin

Determining your character's origin involves choosing a background, a species, and two languages.

A character's background represents the place and occupation that were most formative for the character. The combination of background, species, and languages provides fertile soil for your imagination as you ponder your character's earliest days.

### Choose a Background

Choose your character's background, and write it on your character sheet. You can choose any of the backgrounds detailed in "Character Origins," and your GM might offer additional backgrounds as options.

The background you choose influences step 3, when you determine your character's ability scores.

| Ability | Background |
|---------|------------|
| Strength | Soldier |
| Dexterity | Criminal |
| Constitution | Soldier |
| Intelligence | Sage |
| Wisdom | Acolyte |
| Charisma | Acolyte |

**Record Your Feat.** A background gives you a feat, which grants your character particular capabilities. Write the feat on your character sheet.

**Note Proficiencies.** Your background gives proficiency in two skills and with one tool. Record this information on your character sheet.

Your class also gives proficiencies. Check your class description in "Classes" and note the proficiencies on your character sheet.

### Choose Starting Equipment

Your background and class both provide starting equipment. Any coins that you gain at this step can be immediately spent on equipment from "Equipment."

Record your chosen equipment on your character sheet.

### Choose a Species

Choose a species for your character. The following species options are detailed in "Character Origins": Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goliath, Halfling, Human, Orc, and Tiefling. Once you've chosen a species, write it on your character sheet. Then record your species' traits.

Your character's size and Speed are determined by the character's species; record these in the appropriate places on your character sheet.

### Choose Languages

Your character knows at least three languages: Common plus two languages you roll or choose from the Standard Languages table.

| 1d12 | Language |
|------|----------|
| — | Common |
| 1 | Common Sign Language |
| 2 | Draconic |
| 3–4 | Dwarvish |
| 5–6 | Elvish |
| 7 | Giant |
| 8 | Gnomish |
| 9 | Goblin |
| 10–11 | Halfling |
| 12 | Orc |

## Step 3: Ability Scores

To determine your character's ability scores, you first generate a set of six numbers using the instructions below and then assign them to your six abilities.

### Generate Your Scores

Determine your ability scores by using one of the following three methods. Your GM might prefer you to use a particular one.

**Standard Array.** Use the following six scores for your abilities: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

**Random Generation.** Roll four d6s and record the total of the highest three dice. Do this five more times, so you have six numbers.

**Point Cost.** You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores.

| Score | Cost | Score | Cost |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| 8 | 0 | 12 | 4 |
| 9 | 1 | 13 | 5 |
| 10 | 2 | 14 | 7 |
| 11 | 3 | 15 | 9 |

### Assign Ability Scores

Once you've generated six scores, assign them to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, keeping in mind your class's primary ability. Fill in the ability modifiers as well.

### Adjust Ability Scores

After assigning your ability scores, adjust them according to your background. Your background lists three abilities; increase one of those scores by 2 and a different one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None of these increases can raise a score above 20.

### Determine Ability Modifiers

Finally, determine your ability modifiers using the table below. Write the modifier next to each of your scores.

| Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| 3 | −4 | 12–13 | +1 |
| 4–5 | −3 | 14–15 | +2 |
| 6–7 | −2 | 16–17 | +3 |
| 8–9 | −1 | 18–19 | +4 |
| 10–11 | +0 | 20 | +5 |

## Step 4: Alignment

Choose your character's alignment from the options below, and note it on your character sheet. The game assumes that player characters aren't of an evil alignment. Check with your GM before making an evil character.

### The Nine Alignments

A creature's alignment broadly describes its ethical attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).

**Lawful Good (LG).** Lawful Good creatures endeavor to do the right thing as expected by society.

**Neutral Good (NG).** Neutral Good creatures do the best they can, working within rules but not feeling bound by them.

**Chaotic Good (CG).** Chaotic Good creatures act as their conscience directs with little regard for what others expect.

**Lawful Neutral (LN).** Lawful Neutral individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes.

**Neutral (N).** Neutral is the alignment of those who prefer to avoid moral questions and don't take sides.

**Chaotic Neutral (CN).** Chaotic Neutral creatures follow their whims, valuing their personal freedom above all else.

**Lawful Evil (LE).** Lawful Evil creatures methodically take what they want within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order.

**Neutral Evil (NE).** Neutral Evil is the alignment of those who are untroubled by the harm they cause as they pursue their desires.

**Chaotic Evil (CE).** Chaotic Evil creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their hatred or bloodlust.

## Step 5: Character Details

Now fill in the rest of your character sheet.

### Record Class Features

Look at your class's feature table in "Classes," and write down the level 1 features. Some class features offer choices. Make sure to read all your features and make any offered choices.

### Fill In Numbers

Note these numbers on your character sheet.

**Saving Throws.** For the saving throws you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the appropriate ability modifier and note the total.

**Skills.** For skills you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the ability modifier associated with that skill, and note the total.

**Passive Perception.** Use this formula:

> Passive Perception = 10 + Wisdom (Perception) check modifier

**Hit Points.** Your class and Constitution modifier determine your Hit Point maximum at level 1.

| Class | Hit Point Maximum |
|-------|-------------------|
| Barbarian | 12 + Con. modifier |
| Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger | 10 + Con. modifier |
| Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, or Warlock | 8 + Con. modifier |
| Sorcerer or Wizard | 6 + Con. modifier |

**Hit Point Dice.** Your class's description tells you the die type of your character's Hit Point Dice (or Hit Dice for short). At level 1, your character has 1 Hit Die.

**Initiative.** Write your Dexterity modifier in the space for Initiative.

**Armor Class.** Without armor or a shield, your base Armor Class is 10 plus your Dexterity modifier.

**Attacks.** The attack roll bonus for a weapon with which you have proficiency:

> Melee attack bonus = Strength modifier + Proficiency Bonus
> Ranged attack bonus = Dexterity modifier + Proficiency Bonus

**Spellcasting.** Note both the saving throw DC for your spells and the attack bonus:

> Spell save DC = 8 + spellcasting ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus
> Spell attack bonus = spellcasting ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus
