title: Lifestyle Expenses
description: Cost of living from wretched to aristocratic
---

Lifestyle expenses summarize the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover lodging, food, equipment maintenance, and other necessities.

*This section is a stub. Full descriptions coming soon.*

At the start of each week or month (GM's choice), choose a lifestyle and pay the price to sustain it. Lifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the GM might take them into account when determining risks or how others perceive your character.

## Lifestyles
