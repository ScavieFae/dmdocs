description: Currency denominations and exchange rates

Characters often find coins on their adventures and can spend those coins in shops, inns, and other businesses. Coins come in different denominations based on the relative worth of their material.

A coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

## Selling Equipment

Equipment fetches half its cost when sold. In contrast, trade goods and valuables—like gems and art objects—retain their full value in the marketplace.
