title: Weapons Overview
description: Introduction to weapons, categories, and proficiency
---

The Weapons table shows the game's main weapons. The table lists the cost and weight of each weapon, as well as the following details:

- **Category.** Every weapon falls into a category: Simple or Martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency with Simple weapons.
- **Melee or Ranged.** A weapon is classified as either Melee or Ranged. A Melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet, whereas a Ranged weapon is used to attack at a greater distance.
- **Damage.** The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well as the type of that damage.
- **Properties.** Any properties a weapon has are listed in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the Properties section.
- **Mastery.** Each weapon has a mastery property, which is defined in the Mastery Properties section. To use that property, you must have a feature that lets you use it.

## Weapon Proficiency

Anyone can wield a weapon, but you must have proficiency with it to add your Proficiency Bonus to an attack roll you make with it. A player character's features can provide weapon proficiencies. A monster is proficient with any weapon in its stat block.

## Improvised Weapons

If you use an object—such as a table leg, frying pan, or bottle—as a makeshift weapon, see "Improvised Weapons" in the Rules Glossary. Also see those rules if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.
