description: Rules for using magic items

Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it.

## Donning Magic Items

A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion:
- Boots go on feet
- Gloves on hands
- Hats and helmets on a head
- Rings on a finger
- Magic armor must be donned
- A Shield strapped to the arm
- A cloak fastened about the shoulders
- A weapon must be held

In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.

## Multiple Items of the Same Kind

You can't wear more than one of certain magic items. You can't normally wear more than one:
- Pair of footwear
- Pair of gloves or gauntlets
- Pair of bracers
- Suit of armor
- Item of headwear
- Cloak

The GM might make exceptions.

## Paired Items

Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a *Boot of Striding and Springing* on one foot and a *Boot of Elvenkind* on the other foot gains no benefit from either.
