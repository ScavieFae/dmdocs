description: Rules for using a square grid with miniatures or tokens
---

If you play using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules.

## Squares

Each square represents 5 feet.

## Speed

Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid, using your Speed in 5-foot segments. You can translate your Speed into squares by dividing it by 5. For example, a Speed of 30 feet translates into 6 squares. If you use a grid often, consider writing your Speed in squares on your character sheet.

## Entering a Square

To enter a square, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering. It costs 1 square of movement to enter an unoccupied square that's adjacent to your space (orthogonally or diagonally adjacent). A square of Difficult Terrain costs 2 squares to enter. Other effects might make a square cost even more.

## Corners

Diagonal movement can't cross the corner of a wall, a large tree, or another terrain feature that fills its space.

## Ranges

To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects—count squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.
